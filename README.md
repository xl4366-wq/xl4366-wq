## Hi, I'm Jason Lin 👋

A data science student at NYU who enjoys building practical projects that connect data, cloud systems, and real-world problems. My background mixes data science, software development, and a bit of entrepreneurship from running my own small business. I usually learn by building something end-to-end, and most of my projects come from things I want to fix or understand in real life.
