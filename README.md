## Hi, I'm Jason Lin 👋

📊 Data science student at NYU who enjoys building projects that connect data, cloud systems, and real-world problems.  
💻 Working across Python, SQL, AWS, and full-stack web development — usually building things I personally need or want to understand.  
🌱 Mixing data science, software development, and a bit of entrepreneurship from running my own small business.  
🚀 I learn best by creating end-to-end systems and turning ideas into something that actually works.<br/>
